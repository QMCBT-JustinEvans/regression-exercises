    "1. Create a new repository named ```regression-exercises``` in your ```GitHub```; all of your Regression work will be housed here.\n",
    "2. Clone this repository within your local ```codeup-data-science``` directory.\n",
    "3. Create a ```.gitignore``` and make sure your list of 'files to ignore' includes your ```env.py``` file.\n",
    "4. Ceate a ```README.md``` file that outlines the contents and purpose of your repository.\n",
    "5. ```Add```, ```commit```, and ```push``` these two files.\n",
    "6. Now you can add your ```env.py``` file to this repository to access the ```Codeup database server```.\n",
    "7. For these exercises, you will create ```wrangle.ipynb``` and ```wrangle.py``` files to hold necessary functions.\n",
    "8. As always, ```add```, ```commit```, and ```push``` your work often."
